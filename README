Requires the Adobe Alchemy Toolkit preview.
Specifically, the ALCHEMY_HOME variable should point to your Alchemy directory.

A simple port of LinuxDoom to ActionScript bytecode via Alchemy,
with hooks in place to pass the frame and sound buffers to Flash.

TODO:
- Instead of reading the _ram ByteArray in the AS and setting the BitmapData there, would it be better to instead pass the BitmapData into C and use the AS3_ByteArray functions to draw the frame buffer?  Should avoid the allocation of the gameScreen array.
- Similarly for sound
- Configurable controls, some sort of mouse control
- Try turning singletics back off?  Properly implement I_GetTime using getTimer (or does Alchemy's time.h already do this?)
- Seems to be some slight input lag -- is it related to my stupid implementation of I_GetTime, or is it just the Flash lagging in general, or is everything fine?  I've looked through the game code and haven't found anything yet.
- Implementing music, using Timidity or some other software synthesizer
- Switch to prBoom or some other more advanced source port
